    """
    This class creates a ship from a graphic file, scales according to the size of the surface it shall be drawn on,
    animates the ship and draws it.

    Attributes:
        screen (pygame.Surface): Surface where the ship is drawn on
        width (float): width of the ship
        height (float): height of the ship
        mask (pygame.mask): The mask of the ship (taken from the image) for collision detection
        x (int): x coordinate of the ship's surrounding rectangle
        y (int): y coordinate of the ship's surrounding rectangle

    Methods:
        draw(): draw on screen
        move_left(): move the ship to the left (will not move off-screen)
        move_right(): move the ship to the right (will not move off-screen)
